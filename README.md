# Sign-Language-Detection

In this sign language detection project, I created a sign detector, which detects sign language gestures like Thank You, Hello, No, Yes & I Love You.

__TechStack__: OpenCV, Tensorflow, NumPy, Python


* For creating the datasets, I collected images OpenCV and stored them in two folders: train and test. Then I performed labelling of these images using LabelImg tool. You can see the implementation of this part in data.py file.

* Model training and detection in real time is implemented in SignLanguageDetection.py file.


Here are some outputs:
